The structure, topology and input parameter files used to calculate 
the solvation free energy of nitrocyclohexane described in the 
publication 

M. Reinhardt, H. Grubmüller ... arxiv

are provided here. 

*********** Structure **********

The calculations were conducted in two steps, that are provided 
in the following two folders:

* coulomb_decoupl: In the first step, Coulomb interactions are 
                   decoupled while LJ interactions are maintainted

* lj_decoupl: In the second step, LJ interactions are decoupled
              while Coulomb interactions have already been switched
              off. 

As a comparison, the calculations were firstly conducted with the 
newly implemented Varitaionally Derived Intermediates (VI) method. 
The required VI control paramters have been described in the 
publication mentioned above. These can be found in the folder:

* VI 

In addition, the folder 

* pairwise_sc

provides the files that were used as a comparison withe the 
conventional soft-core paths.

************ Files **********

* mol.top, mol.gro: topology and structure file of nitrocyclohexane
                    in water. These were obtained from the solvation
                    toolkit package from 
                    Caitlin C. Bannan, Gaetano Calabró, Daisy Y. Kyu, 
                    and David L. Mobley
                    J Chem Theory Comput. 2016 Aug 9; 12(8): 4015–4024.
                    DOI: 10.1021/acs.jctc.6b00449

* em_x.mdp, nvt_x.mdp, npt_x.mdp, md_x.mdp:
           Input paramter files for energy minimization, constant vol-
           ume equilibration, constant pressure equilibration and 
           the production runs

************* Usage  ************

For the accuraccy assessments provided in the above publication, 
the simulations were conducted in five states (and later compared to
a reference result from 101 states)

To run the free energy calculations in five states, each mdp files 
needs to be replicated to five files and the paramterer
init_lambda_state  = 0
changed to 0 ... 4

For each state, the steps common to (almost) any MD simulations need 
to be conducted, i.e., energy minimization ...
To do so, generate the tpr files through, e.g.,

$GMX grompp -f md_0.mdp -c npt_0.gro -p mol.top -t npt_0.cpt -o md_0.tpr -maxwarn 3
$GMX mdrun -deffnm md_0

were the path to the executable should be set via

$GMX=...path/gromacs-vi-extension/build/bin/gmx

In the end, the free energy difference can be calulcated, e.g., via
gmx bar -f *.xvg
